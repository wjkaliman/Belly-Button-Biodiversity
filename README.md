# Belly-Button-Biodiversity
This Belly Button Biodiversity project used JavaScript, Plotly, Python, D3, JSON, and HTML to explore the Belly Button Bacteria Biodiversity dataset. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
The data set was read in JSON format and brought in by D3. I built 2 graphs using JavaScript and Plotly. When you select a Sample, the Metadata is displayed in the 2 graphs. The graphs will resize when the page is modified. Thank you for stopping by.
